The explicit-control evaluator of section <a href="34_sec5_4.html#%_sec_5.4">5.4</a> is a
register machine whose controller interprets Scheme programs.  In this
section we will see how to run Scheme programs on a register machine
whose controller is not a Scheme interpreter.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
<a name="%_idx_6196"></a><a name="%_idx_6198"></a>The explicit-control evaluator machine is universal -- it can carry out
any computational process that can be described in Scheme.  The
evaluator's controller orchestrates the use of its data paths to
perform the desired computation.  Thus, the evaluator's data paths are
universal: They are sufficient to perform any computation we desire,
given an appropriate controller.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_794" href="#footnote_Temp_794"><sup><small>33</small></sup></a></p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
<a name="%_idx_6200"></a><a name="%_idx_6202"></a>Commercial general-purpose computers are register machines organized
around a collection of registers and operations that constitute
an efficient and convenient universal set of data paths.
The controller for a general-purpose machine is an interpreter for
a register-machine language like the one we have been using.  This
language is called the <a name="%_idx_6204"></a><em>native language</em> of the machine, or simply
<a name="%_idx_6206"></a><em>machine language</em>.  Programs written in machine language are
sequences of instructions that use the machine's data paths.
For example, the <a name="%_idx_6208"></a>explicit-control evaluator's instruction sequence
can be thought of as a machine-language program for a general-purpose
computer rather than as the controller for a specialized interpreter
machine.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
<a name="%_idx_6210"></a><a name="%_idx_6212"></a>There are two common strategies for bridging the gap between
higher-level languages and register-machine languages.  The
explicit-control evaluator illustrates the
strategy of interpretation.  An interpreter written in the native
language of a machine configures the machine to execute programs
written in a language (called the <a name="%_idx_6214"></a><em>source language</em>) that may
differ from the native language of the machine performing the
evaluation.  The primitive procedures of the source language are
implemented as a library of subroutines written in the native language
of the given machine.  A program to be interpreted (called the <a name="%_idx_6216"></a><em>source program</em>) is represented as a data structure.  The interpreter
traverses this data structure, analyzing the source program.  As it
does so, it simulates the intended behavior of the source program by
calling appropriate primitive subroutines from the library.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
In this section, we explore the alternative strategy of <em>compilation</em>.  A compiler for a given source language and machine
translates a source program into an equivalent program (called the
<a name="%_idx_6218"></a><em>object program</em>) written in the machine's native language.  The
compiler that we implement in this section translates programs written
in Scheme into sequences of instructions to be executed using
the explicit-control evaluator machine's data paths.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_795" href="#footnote_Temp_795"><sup><small>34</small></sup></a></p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">

<p class="orig" lang="en">
Compared with interpretation, compilation can provide a great increase
in the efficiency of program execution, as we will explain below in
the overview of the compiler.  On the other hand, an interpreter
provides a more powerful environment for interactive program
development and debugging, because the source program being executed
is available at run time to be examined and modified.  In addition,
because the entire library of primitives is present, new programs can
be constructed and added to the system during debugging.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
In view of the complementary advantages of compilation and
interpretation, modern program-development environments pursue a mixed
strategy.  Lisp interpreters are generally organized so that
interpreted procedures and compiled procedures can call each other.
This enables a programmer to compile those parts of a program that are
assumed to be debugged, thus gaining the efficiency advantage of
compilation, while retaining the interpretive mode of execution for
those parts of the program that are in the flux of interactive
development and debugging.  In
section <a href="#%_sec_5.5.7">5.5.7</a>, after we have implemented
the compiler, we will show how to interface it with our interpreter to
produce an integrated interpreter-compiler development system.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">

<h4 class="orig" lang="en"><a href="04_toc.html#%_toc_%_sec_Temp_796">An overview of the compiler</a></h4>
<h4 class="trans" lang="ja">コンパイラの概要</h4>

<p class="orig" lang="en"><a name="%_idx_6224"></a><a name="%_idx_6226"></a>
Our compiler is much like our interpreter, both in its structure and in
the function it performs.  Accordingly, the mechanisms used by the
compiler for analyzing expressions will be similar to those used by
the interpreter.  Moreover, to make it easy to interface compiled and
interpreted code, we will design the compiler to generate code that
obeys the same conventions of <a name="%_idx_6228"></a>register usage as the interpreter: The
environment will be kept in the <tt>env</tt> register, argument lists
will be accumulated in <tt>argl</tt>, a procedure to be applied will be
in <tt>proc</tt>, procedures will return their answers in <tt>val</tt>,
and the location to which a procedure should return will be kept in
<tt>continue</tt>.
In general, the compiler translates a source program into an object
program that performs essentially the same register operations as
would the interpreter in evaluating the same source program.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
This description suggests a strategy for implementing a rudimentary
compiler: We traverse the expression in the same way the
interpreter does.  When we encounter a register instruction that the
interpreter would perform in evaluating the expression, we do not
execute the instruction but instead accumulate it into a sequence.  The
resulting sequence of instructions will be the object code.  Observe
the <a name="%_idx_6230"></a><a name="%_idx_6232"></a>efficiency advantage of compilation over interpretation.  Each
time the interpreter evaluates an expression -- for example,
<tt>(f 84 96)</tt> -- it performs the work of
classifying the expression (discovering that this
is a procedure application) and testing for the end of the operand list
(discovering that there are two operands).  With a
compiler, the expression is analyzed only once, when the
instruction sequence is generated at compile time.  The object code
produced by the compiler contains only the instructions that evaluate
the operator and the two operands, assemble the argument list,
and apply the procedure (in <tt>proc</tt>) to the arguments (in <tt>argl</tt>).</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
<a name="%_idx_6234"></a>This is the same kind of optimization we implemented in the
analyzing evaluator of section <a href="26_sec4_1.html#%_sec_4.1.7">4.1.7</a>.
But there are further opportunities to gain efficiency in compiled code.
As the interpreter runs, it follows a process that must be applicable
to any expression in the language.  In contrast, a given segment of
compiled code is meant to execute some particular expression.  This
can make a big difference, for example in the use of the stack to
save registers.  When the interpreter evaluates an expression, it must
be prepared for any contingency.  Before evaluating a subexpression,
the interpreter saves all
registers that will be needed later, because
the subexpression might require an arbitrary evaluation.
A compiler, on the other hand, can exploit the structure of the
particular expression it is processing to generate code that avoids
unnecessary stack operations.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
As a case in point, consider the combination <tt>(f 84 96)</tt>.  Before
the interpreter evaluates the operator of the combination, it prepares
for this evaluation by saving the registers containing the operands
and the environment, whose values will be needed later.  The
interpreter then evaluates the operator to obtain the result in <tt>val</tt>, restores the saved registers, and finally moves the result from
<tt>val</tt> to <tt>proc</tt>.  However, in the particular expression we are
dealing with, the operator is the symbol <tt>f</tt>, whose evaluation is
accomplished by the machine operation <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt>,
which does not alter any registers.  The compiler that we implement in
this section will take advantage of this fact and generate code that
evaluates the operator using the instruction
<p class="lisp">(assign proc (op lookup-variable-value) (const f) (reg env))
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">This code not only avoids the unnecessary saves and
restores but also assigns the value of the lookup directly to
<tt>proc</tt>, whereas the interpreter would obtain the result in <tt>val</tt>
and then move this to <tt>proc</tt>.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
A compiler can also optimize access to the environment.  Having
analyzed the code, the compiler can in many cases know in which frame
a particular variable will be located and access that frame directly,
rather than performing the <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt> search.  We
will discuss how to implement such variable access in
section <a href="#%_sec_5.5.6">5.5.6</a>.  Until then, however, we will
focus on the kind of register and stack optimizations described above.
There are many other optimizations that can be performed by a
compiler, such as coding primitive operations ``in line'' instead of
using a general <tt>apply</tt> mechanism (see
exercise <a href="#%_thm_5.38">5.38</a>); but we will not emphasize these here.
Our main goal in this section is to illustrate the compilation process
in a simplified (but still interesting) context.</p>

<a name="%_idx_6238"></a>In section <a href="26_sec4_1.html#%_sec_4.1.7">4.1.7</a> we modified our original
metacircular interpreter to separate analysis from execution.  We
analyzed each expression to produce an execution procedure that took
an environment as argument and performed the required operations.  In
our compiler, we will do essentially the same analysis.  Instead of
producing execution procedures, however, we will generate sequences of
instructions to be run by our register machine.</p>

<a name="%_idx_6262"></a>Whenever registers might need to be saved, the compiler's code generators use
<a name="%_idx_6264"></a><tt>preserving</tt>, which is a more subtle method for combining
instruction sequences.  <tt>Preserving</tt> takes three arguments: a set
of registers and two instruction sequences that are to be executed
sequentially.  It appends the sequences in such a way that the
contents of each register in the set is preserved over the execution
of the first sequence, if this is needed for the execution of the
second sequence.  That is, if the first sequence modifies the register
and the second sequence actually needs the register's original
contents, then <tt>preserving</tt> wraps a <tt>save</tt> and a <tt>restore</tt>
of the register around the first sequence before appending the
sequences.  Otherwise, <tt>preserving</tt> simply returns the appended
instruction sequences.  Thus, for example,</p>

By using <tt>preserving</tt> to combine instruction sequences the
compiler avoids unnecessary stack operations.  This also isolates the
details of whether or not to generate <tt>save</tt> and <tt>restore</tt>
instructions within the <tt>preserving</tt> procedure, separating them
from the concerns that arise in writing each of the individual code
generators.
In fact no <tt>save</tt> or <tt>restore</tt> instructions are explicitly

In principle, we could represent an instruction sequence simply as a
list of instructions.  <tt>Append-instruction-sequences</tt> could then
combine instruction sequences by performing an ordinary list <tt>append</tt>.  However, <tt>preserving</tt> would then be a complex operation,
because it would have to analyze each instruction sequence to
determine how the sequence uses its registers.  <tt>Preserving</tt>
would be inefficient as well as complex, because it would have to
analyze each of its instruction sequence arguments, even though these
sequences might themselves have been constructed by calls to <tt>preserving</tt>, in which case their parts would have already been
analyzed.  To avoid such repetitious analysis we will associate with each
instruction sequence some information about its register use.
When we construct a basic instruction sequence we
will provide this information explicitly,
and the procedures that combine instruction sequences will derive
register-use information for the combined sequence from the
information associated with the component sequences.</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">After evaluating the elements of a combination, the compiled code must
apply the procedure in <tt>proc</tt> to the arguments in <tt>argl</tt>.  The

<tt>apply-dispatch</tt> entry point in the explicit-control evaluator of
section <a href="34_sec5_4.html#%_sec_5.4.1">5.4.1</a>.  It checks whether the
procedure to be applied is a primitive procedure or a compiled
procedure.  For a primitive procedure, it uses <tt>apply-primitive-procedure</tt>; we will see shortly how it handles
compiled procedures.  The procedure-application code has the following

<p class="orig" lang="en">The code that handles procedure application is the most subtle part of
the compiler, even though the instruction sequences it generates are
very short.  A compiled procedure (as constructed by <tt>compile-lambda</tt>) has an entry point, which is a label that designates
where the code for the procedure starts.  The code at this entry point
computes a result in <tt>val</tt> and returns by executing the
instruction <tt>(goto (reg continue))</tt>.  Thus, we might expect the
code for a compiled-procedure application (to be generated by <tt>compile-proc-appl</tt>) with a given target and linkage to look like this

This section describes the details on how instruction sequences are
represented and combined.  Recall from
section <a href="#%_sec_5.5.1">5.5.1</a> that an instruction sequence
is represented as a list of the registers needed, the registers
modified, and the actual instructions.  We will also consider a label
(symbol) to be a degenerate case of an instruction sequence, which doesn't
need or modify any registers.
So to determine the registers needed
and modified by instruction sequences we use the selectors
</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">

<p class="lisp"><a name="%_idx_6380"></a>(define (registers-needed s)

<a name="%_idx_6384"></a>(define (statements s)
  (if (symbol? s) (list s) (caddr s)))
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">and to determine whether a given
sequence needs or modifies a given register we use the predicates

</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">In terms of these predicates and selectors, we can implement the
various instruction sequence combiners used throughout the compiler.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
The basic combiner is <tt>append-instruction-sequences</tt>.  This takes as
arguments an arbitrary number of instruction sequences that are to be executed
sequentially and returns an instruction sequence whose statements are the
statements of all the sequences appended together.  The subtle point is to
determine the registers that are needed and modified by the resulting
sequence.  It modifies those registers that are modified by any of the
sequences; it needs those registers that must be initialized before the first
sequence can be run (the registers needed by the first sequence), together
with those registers needed by any of the other sequences that are not
initialized (modified) by sequences preceding it.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
The sequences are appended two at a time by <tt>append-2-sequences</tt>.  This
takes two instruction sequences <tt>seq1</tt> and <tt>seq2</tt> and returns the
instruction sequence whose statements are the statements of <tt>seq1</tt>
followed by the statements of <tt>seq2</tt>, whose modified registers are those
registers that are modified by either <tt>seq1</tt> or <tt>seq2</tt>, and whose
needed registers are the registers needed by <tt>seq1</tt> together with those
registers needed by <tt>seq2</tt> that are not modified by <tt>seq1</tt>.  (In terms
of set operations, the new set of needed registers is the union of the set of
registers needed by <tt>seq1</tt> with the set difference of the registers needed
by <tt>seq2</tt> and the registers modified by <tt>seq1</tt>.)  Thus, <tt>append-instruction-sequences</tt> is implemented as follows:</p>

<b>Exercise 5.38.</b>  <a name="%_idx_6422"></a><a name="%_idx_6424"></a>Our compiler is clever about avoiding unnecessary stack operations,
but it is not clever at all when it comes to compiling calls to the primitive
procedures of the language in terms of the primitive operations

in <tt>argl</tt>, puts the primitive addition procedure (which it finds
by looking up the symbol <tt>+</tt> in the environment) into <tt>proc</tt>,
and tests whether the procedure is primitive or compound.  The
compiler always generates code to perform the test, as well as code
for primitive and compound branches (only one of which will be executed).
We have not shown the part of the controller that implements
primitives, but we presume that these instructions make use of
primitive arithmetic operations in the machine's data paths.  Consider
how much less code would be generated if the compiler could <em>open-code</em> primitives -- that is, if it could generate code to directly
use these primitive machine operations.  The expression <tt>(+ a 1)</tt>

One of the most common optimizations performed by compilers is the
optimization of variable lookup.  Our compiler, as we have implemented
it so far, generates code that uses the <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt>
operation of the evaluator machine.  This searches for a variable by
comparing it with each variable that is currently bound, working frame
by frame outward through the run-time environment.  This search can be
expensive if the frames are deeply nested or if there are many
variables.  For example, consider the problem of looking up the value
of <tt>x</tt> while evaluating the expression <tt>(* x y z)</tt> in an
application of the procedure that is returned by</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="lisp">(let ((x 3) (y 4))
  (lambda (a b c d e)
    (let ((y (* a b x))
          (z (+ c d x)))
      (* x y z))))
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">Since a <tt>let</tt> expression is just syntactic sugar for a <tt>lambda</tt> combination, this expression is equivalent to</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="lisp">((lambda (x y)
   (lambda (a b c d e)
     ((lambda (y z) (* x y z))
      (* a b x)
      (+ c d x))))
 3
 4)
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">Each time <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt> searches for <tt>x</tt>, it must
determine that the symbol <tt>x</tt> is not <tt>eq?</tt> to <tt>y</tt> or <tt>z</tt> (in the first frame), nor to <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>c</tt>, <tt>d</tt>, or
<tt>e</tt> (in the second frame).  We will assume, for the moment, that
our programs do not use <tt>define</tt> -- that variables are
bound only with <tt>lambda</tt>.  Because our language is <a name="%_idx_6432"></a>lexically
scoped, the run-time environment for any expression will have a
structure that parallels the lexical structure of the program in which
the expression appears.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_824" href="#footnote_Temp_824"><sup><small>45</small></sup></a>
Thus, the compiler can know, when it analyzes the
above expression, that each time the procedure is applied the variable
<tt>x</tt> in <tt>(* x y z)</tt> will be found two frames out from the
current frame and will be the first variable in that frame.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
<a name="%_idx_6434"></a>We can exploit this fact by inventing a new kind of variable-lookup
operation, <tt>lexical-address-lookup</tt>, that takes as arguments an
environment and a <em>lexical address</em> that consists of two numbers:
a <em>frame number</em>, which specifies how many frames to pass over,
and a <em>displacement number</em>, which specifies how many variables to
pass over in that frame.  <a name="%_idx_6436"></a><tt>Lexical-address-lookup</tt> will produce
the value of the variable stored at that lexical address relative to
the current environment.  If we add the <tt>lexical-address-lookup</tt>
operation to our machine, we can make the compiler generate code that
references variables using this operation, rather than <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt>.  Similarly, our compiled code can use a new
<a name="%_idx_6438"></a><tt>lexical-address-set!</tt>  operation instead of <tt>set-variable-value!</tt>.</p>

<p class="trans" lang="ja">
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
In order to generate such code, the compiler must be able to determine
the lexical address of a variable it is about to compile a reference
to.  The lexical address of a variable in a program depends on where
one is in the code.  For example, in the following program, the
address of <tt>x</tt> in expression &lt;<em>e1</em>&gt; is (2,0) -- two frames back
and the first variable in the frame.  At that point <tt>y</tt> is at
address (0,0) and <tt>c</tt> is at address (1,2).  In expression
&lt;<em>e2</em>&gt;,  <tt>x</tt> is at (1,0),   <tt>y</tt> is at (1,1), and <tt>c</tt> is at (0,2).</p>

      &lt;<em>e2</em>&gt;
      (+ c d x))))
 3
 4)
</p>

<p class="orig" lang="en">
<a name="%_idx_6440"></a>One way for the compiler to produce code that uses lexical addressing
is to maintain a data structure called a <em>compile-time
environment</em>.  This keeps track of which variables will be at which
positions in which frames in the run-time environment when a
particular variable-access operation is executed.  The compile-time
environment is a list of frames, each containing a list of variables.
(There will of course be no values bound to the variables, since

and causes the machine to run the code in the
evaluator global environment, print the result, and
enter the evaluator's driver loop.  We will also modify the evaluator so that
interpreted expressions can call compiled procedures as well as interpreted
ones.  We can then put a compiled procedure into the machine and use the
evaluator to call it:</p>

we need to change the code at <tt>apply-dispatch</tt>
(section <a href="34_sec5_4.html#%_sec_5.4.1">5.4.1</a>) so that it recognizes
compiled procedures (as distinct from compound or primitive

alternative execution strategies of interpretation and

the machine to the level of the user program; a compiler lowers the
user program to the level of the machine language.  We can regard the
Scheme language (or any programming language) as a coherent family of
abstractions erected on the machine language.  Interpreters are good
for interactive program development and debugging because the steps of
program execution are organized in terms of these abstractions, and
are therefore more intelligible to the programmer.  Compiled code can
execute faster, because the steps of program execution are organized
in terms of the machine language, and the compiler is free to make
optimizations that cut across the higher-level
abstractions.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_838" href="#footnote_Temp_838"><sup><small>52</small></sup></a></p>

change the code generators so that they generate code for the new

run-time library.<a name="call_footnote_Temp_839" href="#footnote_Temp_839"><sup><small>53</small></sup></a>  Better yet, we can compile the compiler itself, and run

<br>
Take the ratio of the number of pushes in the compiled version to the
number of pushes in the interpreted version, and do the same for the
maximum stack depth.  Since the number of operations and the stack
depth used to compute <em>n</em>! are linear in <em>n</em>, these ratios should
approach constants as <em>n</em> becomes large.  What are these constants?
Similarly, find the ratios of the stack usage in the special-purpose
machine to the usage in the interpreted version.
<br>
Compare the ratios for special-purpose versus interpreted code to the ratios

the hand-tailored controller code should be much better than what is

<a name="%_idx_6356"></a>compiler generate tail-recursive code might seem like a
straightforward idea.  But most compilers for common languages,
including C and Pascal, do not do this, and therefore these languages
cannot represent iterative processes in terms of procedure call alone.
The difficulty with <a name="%_idx_6358"></a><a name="%_idx_6360"></a><a name="%_idx_6362"></a>tail recursion in these languages is that their
implementations use the stack to store procedure arguments and local
variables as well as return addresses.  The Scheme implementations
described in this book store arguments and variables in memory to be
garbage-collected.  The reason for using the stack for variables and
arguments is that it avoids the need for garbage collection in
languages that would not otherwise require it, and is generally
believed to be more efficient.  Sophisticated Lisp compilers can, in
fact, use the stack for arguments without destroying tail recursion.
(See <a name="%_idx_6364"></a>Hanson 1990 for a description.)  There is also some debate about
whether stack allocation is actually more efficient than garbage
collection in the first place, but the details seem to hinge on fine
points of computer architecture.  (See <a name="%_idx_6366"></a>Appel 1987 and <a name="%_idx_6368"></a><a name="%_idx_6370"></a>Miller and Rozas

critical applications where speed is not a constraint.  Their programs
lead fast and dangerous lives.  For example, the notorious <a name="%_idx_6498"></a>``Worm''

to write as many of these operations as possible in Lisp and then

whether the compilation of a program on the new machine, using the

down the source of differences is fun but often frustrating, because
the results are extremely sensitive to minuscule details.
